# 💼 Aashutosh's Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my interactive portfolio! This project showcases my technical skills, projects, and creative ideas through both a sleek **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and **Command Line Interface (CLI)** version.

## Introduction

In today's digital world, a portfolio shouldn't just be a static webpage. That's why I created a **dual-mode portfolio** that reflects my versatility as a developer – whether you're into elegant front-end design or no-nonsense command-line tools.

This portfolio is built to **present, interact, and even entertain**, while giving a complete insight into who I am and what I build.
